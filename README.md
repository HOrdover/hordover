Remember that Libsyn Six-Midroll Ad email letter? 

Yeah, that's why you're seeing this information—because that was the first doooonnnnnngggg of a death knell that's still affecting CraftLit's long-term planning.

But happily, that only means good things for you!

TL:DR - if you are not interested in listening to CraftLit Premium audio and ad-free regular episodes on the podcatcher of your choice*, skip the next bit.


* period—no logging in elsewhere once you're set up -you, your podcatcher, and Moby Dick, baby! Nothing else needed.

So, this is the first step in a longer process, and this should be the only step you need to make a decision about. 

I'm moving CraftLit off Patreon (permanently) and onto Supercast.


But Heather (I hear you say), perhaps you haven't noticed that we are not on Patreon. 

You are correct!
But even so, you may want to make this move, too.


What you get by moving:

all CraftLit episodes ad-free (no matter what Libsyn does in the future);
the ability to listen to Ad-free Craftlit and Premium audio on the podcatcher of your choice—including Spotify—without logging in here, or on Patreon, or needing yet another separate app.
Easy access to Discord, easy announcement delivery (so you know right away if something goes pear-shaped in releasing audio to you), an easy comment/question interface, and more improvements to Supercast are planned for the future.
Tiers stay the same as they've been for several years.

The Tiers stay exactly the same (you can see them here) and what you get stays exactly the same (well, honestly, ease of access improves markedly). My biggest surprise is that my cut of the fees you pay is better on Supercast than anywhere else—Including here.

Even if you choose not to move to Supercast, please know that through Supercast we can offer GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS! (CraftLit Premium is a great Christmas or Hannukah present!)
